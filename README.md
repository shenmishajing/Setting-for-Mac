# Setting-for-Mac

Run the following commands to create soft links to your home directory. Of course, you can check the `setup.sh` before you run it. The `setup.sh` is modularized, you can comment out the modules you don't want to run.

```bash
# install oh my zsh first
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

# setup configs
sh setup.sh
```
